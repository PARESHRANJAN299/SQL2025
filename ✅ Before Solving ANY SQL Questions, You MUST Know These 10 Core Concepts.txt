✅ Before Solving ANY SQL Questions, You MUST Know These 10 Core Concepts
1️⃣ SELECT → FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → ORDER BY (SQL Execution Flow)

Always remember the order:

FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → SELECT → ORDER BY


Why important?
Because:

WHERE filters rows before grouping

GROUP BY makes groups

HAVING filters groups (you didn't learn it yet)

2️⃣ WHERE ≠ HAVING → MOST COMMON CONFUSION

Since you have NOT learned HAVING yet, remember:

WHERE is used for row conditions

HAVING is used for group conditions

Example you wrote incorrectly earlier:

❌

SELECT SUM(salary)
FROM emp
WHERE SUM(salary) > 100000


This is wrong because WHERE cannot check aggregate values.

You must use HAVING (later when you learn).

3️⃣ Every Column in SELECT Must Be Either:

✔ Inside an aggregate (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
OR
✔ Appearing in GROUP BY

Example (correct):

SELECT department, COUNT(*)
FROM emp
GROUP BY department;


Incorrect example (you had similar mistakes):

❌

SELECT department, COUNT(*), salary
FROM emp
GROUP BY department;


Because salary is not grouped or aggregated.

4️⃣ NULL Handling (VERY IMPORTANT)

Before advanced SQL, know:

NULL means unknown

NULL != ''

NULL will break SUM, AVG, COUNT(column)

Examples:

COUNT(*) counts NULL
COUNT(column) ignores NULL

5️⃣ LIKE + Wildcards

You must be perfect with pattern matching:

Pattern	Meaning
LIKE 'A%'	Starts with A
LIKE '%A'	Ends with A
LIKE '%A%'	Contains A
LIKE '_A%'	Second letter A
6️⃣ DISTINCT — When to Use and When NOT

Use DISTINCT only when you want unique rows.

Never use DISTINCT with GROUP BY — both do uniqueness.

7️⃣ Subqueries (Basic Understanding)

Subqueries inside WHERE are important because you can replace HAVING with them (as you want right now).

Example:

SELECT department
FROM emp
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp);

8️⃣ Aliases — MUST KNOW

You should always name aggregates:

SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary


Otherwise SQL becomes confusing and some queries fail.

9️⃣ ORDER BY Must Use Selected Column or Expression

Example:

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM emp
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY total DESC;

🔟 Practice Reading Query Results in Your Mind

Before running the query, ask:

What is the WHERE filtering?

What column groups?

What aggregates apply?

What will the final rows look like?

This will make your SQL very strong.

👇 Why I say you NEED this?

From your earlier queries I noticed:
You used WHERE with aggregates ❌
You selected columns without grouping ❌
You added salary column along with COUNT ❌
You missed aliases in some queries ❌
You replaced HAVING with wrong logic ❌
You forgot ORDER BY in many result-based queries
This is normal — and I will fix all of this for you.
