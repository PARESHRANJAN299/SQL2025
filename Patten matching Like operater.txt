🤓 Quick Formula to Remember
Words	Spaces	Pattern
1 word	0 spaces	no LIKE needed
2 words	1 space	LIKE '% %' AND NOT LIKE '% % %'
3 words	2 spaces	LIKE '% % %' AND NOT LIKE '% % % %'
4 words	3 spaces	LIKE '% % % %' AND NOT LIKE '% % % % %'

✅ Meaning of % % %

The pattern:

% % %


Is actually this:

%  ← anything before first space  
(space)
%  ← anything between spaces  
(space)
%  ← anything after second space


So the pattern matches:

anything + space + anything + space + anything

👉 This means at least two separate spaces in the text.

✅ Example of how % % % works
Matches:
"Apple iPhone 15"          → Apple␣iPhone␣15   (2 spaces)
"Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra" → Samsung␣Galaxy␣S21␣Ultra (3 spaces)
"HP Pro Laptop Bag"        → HP␣Pro␣Laptop␣Bag (3 spaces)


All these match because they have 2 or more spaces.

❌ Does NOT match:
"iPhone 15"        → 1 space only
"PowerBank"        → no space
"USB Cable"        → 1 space only

⭐ So yes:
% % % = string containing two or more spaces

And because 2 spaces = 3 words, this works perfectly for:

❌ Excluding 3-word or 4-word names
✔ Keeping only 2-word names
