Paresh, this confusion is 100% normal — and I will break it so clearly that after this you will never confuse LIKE, NOT LIKE, and [^ ] again.

Let’s solve your exact doubt:

❗ Your question (in simple words):

If %[^a-zA-Z]% means “match non-alphabet characters”,
and I put NOT LIKE, then why any result comes?
Shouldn’t everything be removed?

You feel that NOT will reject both letters and non-letters.
But that is not how SQL works.

Let’s clear this step by step.

⭐ PART 1 — Understand this FIRST:
%[^a-zA-Z]% means:

👉 Show rows where there is at least ONE character NOT in A–Z.

That means these match:

Apple** **Juice (space)

Sony-TV (-)

Dell123

TATA@Steel (@)

So %[^a-zA-Z]% = BAD CHARACTERS MATCH
(non-letter characters)

⭐ PART 2 — Now apply the NOT
NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%' means:

❌ Reject everything that matched
✔ Keep everything that DID NOT match

So SQL thinks like this:

Word	Does it contain non-letter?	LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%'	NOT LIKE result
Apple	NO	NO	✔ YES (allowed)
Sony-TV	YES	YES	❌ NO (rejected)
Dell123	YES	YES	❌ NO
TATA	NO	NO	✔ YES
⭐ WHY DOESN’T IT BECOME EMPTY?

Because some names do not contain ANY non-letter characters.
Example:

Apple → all alphabets

Sony → all alphabets

Lenovo → all alphabets

Samsung → all alphabets

They DO NOT match %[^a-zA-Z]% because they contain zero bad characters.

So:

LIKE returns FALSE

NOT LIKE returns TRUE

👉 So they appear in output.

🧠 KEY POINT TO FIX YOUR CONFUSION

You think:

%[^a-zA-Z]% = “do not show letters”

But NO.

❗ This is wrong understanding

[^a-zA-Z] does NOT mean “do not show alphabets”.

It means:

👉 Match a character that is NOT alphabet.

This is a positive match for bad characters,
NOT a negative match for good characters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Corrected Version of Your Statement (Very Simple Logic)

%[^a-zA-Z]%
✔ will show rows that contain any non-alphabet character, such as:
Apple!, ball2, cat-, @home, space.

❌ It will NOT show rows that contain only alphabets, like:
Paresh, Ranjan, Rout.

NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%'
👉 works completely opposite.

So:

Whatever %[^a-zA-Z]% allowed, NOT LIKE will block.
(like Apple!, ball2, cat-)

Whatever %[^a-zA-Z]% blocked, NOT LIKE will allow.
(like Paresh, Ranjan, Rout)

✅ Final simple truth (your idea, corrected into perfect English):

“What LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%' allows, NOT LIKE will not allow.
What LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%' does not allow, NOT LIKE will allow.
It’s just TRUE–FALSE reversal.”

✅ Even simpler version (perfect for interviews)

%[^a-zA-Z]% → finds bad characters

NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%' → finds only alphabetic values


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paresh… YES!! EXACTLY!!
Now you finally understood it in the correct simple logic.
And your explanation is now perfect.

Let me rewrite your understanding in clean simple lines:

✅ Your Final Understanding (Correct)
✔ 1. %[^a-zA-Z]% → Shows “BAD characters” words

This condition allows:

Apple!

ball2

cat-

@dog

Hello World (space)

Because these contain at least ONE non-alphabet character.

It will NOT show:

Paresh

Ranjan

Rout

Apple
(because these contain ONLY alphabets)

So far, PERFECT understanding ✔

✔ 2. Add NOT — Reverse the condition completely
NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%' means:

❌ Block everything that %[^a-zA-Z]% allowed
✔ Allow everything that %[^a-zA-Z]% blocked

Your statement is 200% correct:

“Simple: What LIKE allows, NOT LIKE blocks.
And what LIKE blocks, NOT LIKE will allow.”

Yes! That is the EXACT truth.

✔ 3. Final logic (you nailed it)
👉 LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%'

Matches: ❌ Bad (special chars, digits)

👉 NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%'

Matches: ✔ Good (ONLY alphabets)
This is TRUE vs FALSE switching.
LIKE is TRUE → NOT makes it FALSE
LIKE is FALSE → NOT makes it TRUE

And SQL returns only TRUE rows.

🔥 YOUR LINE IS 100% CORRECT:

“simple what they allowed, NOT will not allow,
what they not allow, NOT will allow.”

YES. EXACTLY.

Now your understanding is strong.
You are ready for any LIKE pattern interview question.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


how we will consider Not- will true : and ^ will false and true will win here ?



🎯 FIRST: Remember the RULE
✔ LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%'

Checks does the value contain ANY non-letter?

Non-letters =
0–9, space, @, !, -, _, #, %, etc.

If NON-letter found → TRUE
If NO NON-letter → FALSE

🎯 SECOND: Remember what NOT does

NOT = reverse the result

NOT TRUE → FALSE

NOT FALSE → TRUE

That's all.

Now let’s break the two cases one by one.
✅ CASE 1: "Apple!"
Step 1 → Check inside LIKE

String = Apple!
Contains ! = non-letter

So this part:

LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%'

= TRUE ✔

Step 2 → Apply NOT

NOT TRUE = FALSE ❌

FINAL RESULT

This row is removed because final result is FALSE.

❗ Why removed?

Because your WHERE condition must be TRUE for a row to come in the result.
Here final result = FALSE, so SQL removes it.

✅ CASE 2: "Paresh"
Step 1 → Check inside LIKE

String = Paresh

Does it contain:

digits? → No
symbols? → No
spaces? → No

So:

LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z]%'

= FALSE ❌
(Because NO non-letter present)

Step 2 → Apply NOT
NOT FALSE = TRUE ✔
FINAL RESULT
This row appears in output.
--------------------------------------

WHY does SQL return the row when the result becomes TRUE after NOT? Why not return FALSE? yes, and , here both the condition ✔ TRUE → FALSE → row NOT shown ✔ FALSE → TRUE → row SHOWN, i understnd row SHOWN will visable as output right ? , but how it work and calculate : TRUE → FALSE = FALSE → TRUE: what is the output :how it become a true : that i want to understand
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the MAIN RULE of SQL WHERE clause.
✔ TRUE → Row appears
❌ FALSE → Row does NOT appear

“FALSE → TRUE → what is the output?
why SQL chooses TRUE?” 

🎯 FACT 2 — NOT only flips (reverses) the result
NOT does ONLY ONE JOB:
If something was TRUE → it becomes FALSE
If something was FALSE → it becomes TRUE
NO extra logic. NOTHING else.
🎉 You understood correctly — just needed clean wording.
